The COP intends to provide a two-fold service that aims to support grid operators (i.e., in this case Pilot case for District Heating Operator (DHO) and the DSO) for i) obtaining comprehensive analytics on the installed flexibility and the spatio-temporal flexibility availability across their grids, ii) allow them the to announce/post flexibility needs (defined as quantity; product-service type) which is communicated via the OneNet connector to the FAR users, but also to populate (amongst each other DSO-DHO) cross-energy flexibility sharing.

The service is available at https://enershare-app.eurodyn.com/cop/login upon request of credentials at konstantinos.kotsalos@eurodyn.com.
