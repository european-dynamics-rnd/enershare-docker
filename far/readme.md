The Flexibility Analytics and Register Service (FAR) intends to provide a two-fold service that aims to support Flexibility Service Providers (i.e., Aggregators, end-users, but namely actorsâ€™ with certain knowledge of managing an energy portfolio) for i) managing their portfolio in a streamlined manner (uploading fresh time-series data), registering a assets and managing them on groups, all via graphical user interface, ii) obtain user-specific analytics via requesting the FAR service to post-process the data owned by the user as well as analytics related to grids (i.e., grid needs) and flexibility analytics by considering aggregated FSP data. In the final version, the FAR has been extended with the categorization of FSPs in the following roles {Electricity Aggregator, Thermal Grid Aggregator and Cross-Energy Aggregator}. This concepts allows for three occurring asset and flexibility register Electricity, Thermal domains and the cross-energy one. FSP role Cross-Energy Aggregator has the proxy to register assets from both domain and provide flexibility accordingly to both.
